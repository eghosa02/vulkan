# Vulkan Engine in C++

This repository contains a Vulkan-based rendering engine written in C++. The engine utilizes GLW for window creation and management and GLM for linear algebra operations.

## Features

- **Cross-platform:** The engine is designed to work seamlessly across different platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, leveraging GLW for windowing.
- **Efficient Rendering:** Utilizes the Vulkan API for high-performance rendering with low-level control over the GPU.
- **Modular Design:** The engine is structured with modularity in mind, allowing for easy integration of new features and extensions.
- **Shader Support:** Provides support for shaders written in GLSL for customizable rendering effects.
- **Resource Management:** Efficient management of GPU resources such as buffers, textures, and pipelines.
- **Math Library:** Includes GLM for vector and matrix operations tailored for graphics programming.
